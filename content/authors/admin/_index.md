# Short bio (displayed in user profile at end of posts)
bio: My work employs deep learning and statistical modeling to address analytical challenges of single cell RNA-sequencing and other high dimensional data. Much of my experience is focused on benchmarking and characterizing the expansive space of existing methods in this field, as well as seeking out state of the art performance and designing novel algorithms. Beyond this, I’m very interested in translational medicine and cancer biology, as a trainee in Yale’s Cancer Biology Training Program.
